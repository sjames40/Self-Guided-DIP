# Self-Guided-DIP

## Overview
This repository implements the **Self-Guided Deep Image Prior (DIP)** technique, which enables effective unsupervised learning for image restoration tasks. The approach leverages the inherent structure of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to solve inverse problems in imaging.

## Features
- **Self-Guided DIP**: Apply self-guidance during DIP to improve restoration quality.
- **Model Implementations**: Includes model architectures like UNet.
- **Image Restoration**: Enhance image quality without supervision.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjames40/Self-Guided-DIP.git
```

2 Install the required dependencies:
```bash
conda create --name self-guided-dip
